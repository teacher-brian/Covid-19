README.TXT

This is just a quick descriptin of the contents in these files.

Notice the file structure by going to the files pane.  You should see this file, a .Rproj file, a few files preceded by a '.' and 3 directories (or folders).

You can ignore what is in the 'tidy' directory for now.  I wrote those files to clean up the raw data.

The raw data is stored in the "data" directory.

You'll use the scripts directory.  Open it to find 2 files.  Some advocate putting dates into your file names but for now I don't think that is necessary.


You will need the following packages to work:

tidyverse
ggplot2
lubridate
here

Install them in rstudio first by running the install.packages() command:

install.packages('tidyverse')  #notice the quotes.  Single or double quotes work as long as they are consistent
